The same back and forth
Leave it out the door
Same, same
Real FOMO
But I'm always M.I.A
No controllin', everything I contemplate
Been seasons, moving through them, that's okay
Keep checkin' in, see if you might count these ways
I try harder than your boyfriend does
But you will never know, it's a lonely feeling
My my, I'ma sheep in these wolves clothes
But you will never know I'm out in the deep end
Real FOMO
To bad seeing your dumb face
I'm a nervous, like when you spin on my days
Do you like it? When you told me they keep blame
I'm checkin', see if you might count these ways
And I hate to think that I'm last, oh
I try harder than your boyfriend does
But you will never know, it's a lonely feeling
My my, I'ma sheep in these wolves clothes
But you will never know I'm out in the deep end
I try harder than your boyfriend does
But you will never know, it's a lonely feeling
My my, I'ma sheep in these wolves clothes
But you will never know I'm out in the deep end
It's the same back and forth
Leave it out the door
Same, same
